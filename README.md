## 💜 A Tribute to Windows Phone

**This project is a heartfelt tribute to Windows Phone OS** – an operating system that was truly ahead of its time but never got the recognition it deserved.

Windows Phone was discontinued in 2017, but its legacy lives on in the hearts of millions who experienced its beauty, simplicity, and innovation. This project exists to:

# Windows Phone Experience

> Windows Phone Experience is a web-based simulator that recreates the iconic Windows Phone and Nokia Lumia UI in your browser. Built with React 19 and Vite, it features live tiles, Metro design language, and classic Lumia aesthetics as a PWA.

Important notes:
- This is a UI simulation/tribute project, not an actual Windows Phone emulator
- Built with React 19, Vite 7, and React Router 7
- PWA-ready for installation on any device
- Preserves the memory of Windows Phone OS (2010-2017)
